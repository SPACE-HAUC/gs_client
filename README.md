# ground_station
Graphical user interface for SPACE-HAUC Ground Station operations.  
  
### Current State
The Client packages and sends ClientServerFrames over a socket connection. The outbound connection is enduced by the operator via the Connections Manager window. Currently sent and received data can be viewed either through the Linux Terminal or in the 'Plaintext RX Display' and 'ACS Update Display' windows. Received ClientServerFrames are currently parsed and displayed, but no further functionality is implemented yet. Outbound ClientServerFrames undergo an integrity check before they are allowed to be sent.  

### Connections Testing  
2021.07.29b
Port connection issue fixed, see ground_station_server repository for more information.

2021.07.29  
Failing to connect to server via port 54210, all others work. Successfully sends, receives, and displays status info.  
  
2021.07.27
Successfully connected to server (see: ground_station_server repo), sends ClientServerFrames, and receives ClientServerFrames.

2021.07.26
The receive thread automatically finds and binds to the local IPv4 address, with a port of 51934. If the auto-detect fails, a default address of 127.0.0.1 is used. The receive thread will attempt to bind infinitely until it does successfully.  
  
The Connections Manager fills in its own receiver thread IPv4 address and port in the IP Address and Port fields. This enables the operator to press 'Connect,' and connect back into the client's own receiver thread. In the Connections Manager window, a JPEG Quality field should appear. The '+' and '-' buttons can be used to send sample data over this connection. The results of this are viewable in the Linux Terminal. The JPEG example should cause an integrity failure, however if data is sent using the Data-down Arrow Buttons the integrity check should return successfully.  
  
### Known Issues

Leeway: Z Angular Momentum Target  (tolerable error)
W-Target: Target angular momentum vector

ISUN: Solar generated current

TMP SHDN: At this temperture it shuts down (max temp)

TMP OP: After Temp. shutdown, at what temperature does it come back on.

Adding Tooltips~

    // ImGui::TextDisabled("(?)");
    // if (ImGui::IsItemHovered())
    // {
    //     ImGui::BeginTooltip();
    //     ImGui::PushTextWrapPos(ImGui::GetFontSize() * 35.0f);
    //     ImGui::TextUnformatted("Text Unformatted");
    //     ImGui::PopTextWrapPos();
    //     ImGui::EndTooltip();
    // }

Splitting into Columns~

    // static int test1 = 0, test2 = 0, test3 = 0;
    // ImGui::Columns(3, "first_column_set", true);
    // ImGui::InputInt("test1", &test1);
    // ImGui::NextColumn();
    // ImGui::InputInt("test2", &test2);
    // ImGui::NextColumn();
    // ImGui::InputInt("test3", &test3);
